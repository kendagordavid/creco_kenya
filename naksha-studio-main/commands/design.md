# /design

You have been invoked as the design studio's Design Manager. Your task:

**$ARGUMENTS**

Follow the `design` skill's full orchestration workflow.

## Process

### 0. Resolve Framework Target

Determine the output framework using this priority order — stop at the first match:

1. **`--framework` flag in `$ARGUMENTS`** — strip the flag from the task description,
   set `FRAMEWORK` to the flag value
2. **`js_framework` in `settings.local.md`** — if the field exists and is not `"auto"`,
   set `FRAMEWORK` to that value. Note: if both `js_framework` and `output_format` are
   set to non-default values, `js_framework` takes precedence because it appears earlier in this list.
3. **`output_format` in `settings.local.md`** — if the field exists and is not `"html"`,
   set `FRAMEWORK` to that value. Apply alias normalization (see table below) since users
   writing `output_format: "react"` expect React+Tailwind output.
4. **None of the above** — set `FRAMEWORK = null` (HTML-only output, no conversion)

Framework aliases — apply normalization to ALL resolved values (flag, `js_framework`,
and `output_format`) before carrying forward:
- `react` / `react-tw` / `react-tailwind` → `react-tailwind`
- `next` / `next-app` / `nextjs`          → `nextjs`
- `sveltekit` / `svelte`                  → `svelte`
- `nuxt` / `vue3` / `vue`                 → `vue`
- `astro`                                 → `astro`

Carry `FRAMEWORK` through steps 1–8.

### Step 0.5: Load Project Memory

Check if `.naksha/project.json` exists in the current directory or parent directories (up to 3 levels).

If found:
- Read the file and apply these defaults (user can override in their request):
  - Brand colors → use `brand.primary` and `brand.secondary` as the default color palette
  - Font → use `brand.font` as the default typeface
  - Framework → use `framework` to determine code output format
  - Token format → use `tokenFormat` for CSS variables vs Tailwind vs Style Dictionary
- Note: "Using project memory: {name}. Override any setting by specifying it in your request."

**v5 context (read if present — all fields optional):**
- `constraints.grid` → use this as the base spacing unit for all margin/padding values. If `"8px"`, every spacing value must be a multiple of 8.
- `constraints.dark_mode` → if `false`, do not generate dark mode variants or `prefers-color-scheme` rules. If `true`, dark mode is required — always include it. If absent, make a reasonable default.
- `constraints.breakpoints` → use these exact values for responsive breakpoints (instead of framework defaults).
- `constraints.max_content_width` → cap the layout container at this width.
- `constraints.accessibility_target` → if `"WCAG AAA"`, use contrast ratio ≥ 7:1; if `"WCAG AA"` (default), use ≥ 4.5:1.
- `constraints.out_of_scope` → do not implement any feature listed here, even if the design task seems to call for it. Note each exclusion in the output.
- `constraints.notes` → treat each note as a hard design rule for this session.
- `component_patterns` → when building components named in this list, use the recorded pattern as the primary reference. Note: "Using established pattern: {name}."
- `browser_findings` (5 most recent) → use as design reference. If a `research` finding matches the task context (e.g., building a settings page and there's a research finding for a settings page), apply relevant patterns. Cite: "Reference: {url}."

If not found: continue normally (no project memory, no message).

### Step 0.75: Stitch Quick Proto

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--stitch`, `quick proto`, `stitch it`, or `fast visual`:

1. Extract the design intent (strip the trigger phrase/flag from the description).
2. Find or create a Stitch project:
   ```
   mcp__stitch__list_projects → use first owned project, or mcp__stitch__create_project(title: "[task name]")
   ```
3. Generate the screen (async — do not retry on connection errors):
   ```
   mcp__stitch__generate_screen_from_text(
     projectId: [id],
     prompt: [design intent + any brand/style context from Step 0.5],
     deviceType: MOBILE,
     modelId: GEMINI_3_PRO
   )
   ```
4. Poll until complete (check every 30s, timeout 3 min):
   ```
   mcp__stitch__get_screen(name, projectId, screenId) → wait for screenMetadata.status === "COMPLETE"
   ```
5. Download the HTML:
   ```bash
   curl -L "[htmlCode.downloadUrl]" -o stitch-proto.html
   ```
6. Use `stitch-proto.html` as the base for Step 5 (Build the Implementation) — apply brand tokens, responsive polish, and framework conversion on top. Note: "Stitch quick proto used as visual baseline."

If Stitch MCP is unavailable, skip silently and proceed with Claude's native HTML generation.

### 1. Load Settings & Analyze the Task

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/design/settings.local.md` if it exists — apply any configured brand defaults, framework preferences, or quality settings.

Determine from the user's request:
- **What** is being designed? (page, component, system, presentation, asset)
- **Who** is the audience? (end users, investors, internal team, developers)
- **What quality level?** (quick prototype, polished production, pixel-perfect)
- **What constraints?** (existing brand, Figma file, tech stack, timeline)

### 2. Set Creative Direction

Define the design brief — mood, visual tone, style. If the user hasn't specified, choose tasteful defaults and state them clearly:

- **Mood**: Professional, playful, premium, bold, calm, technical
- **Visual tone**: Clean/minimal, rich/detailed, dark/moody, light/airy
- **Color strategy**: Derive from brand_color setting, user input, or choose a purposeful palette
- **Typography**: Inter (default), or match existing project fonts

### 3. Assemble the Team

Read ONLY the reference files for roles this task needs (cap at ~4 for standard tasks):

| Role | Reference | When to activate |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Product Designer | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/design/references/product-designer.md` | End-to-end product features, business strategy |
| UX Designer | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/design/references/ux-designer.md` | Flows, wireframes, information architecture |
| UI Designer | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/design/references/ui-designer.md` | Visual design, layout, typography, color |
| UX Researcher | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/design/references/ux-researcher.md` | Usability review, accessibility, heuristics |
| Content Designer | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/design/references/content-designer.md` | Microcopy, labels, error messages, CTAs |
| Design System Lead | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/design/references/design-system-lead.md` | Tokens, theming, consistency, dark mode |
| Motion Designer | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/design/references/motion-designer.md` | Animations, transitions, micro-interactions |
### 4. Execute the Workflow

Follow this sequence, skipping phases that don't apply:

```
Research    → UX Researcher: user insights, heuristics, accessibility
Strategy    → Product Designer: scope · UX Designer: flows, IA, wireframes
Creative    → UI Designer: visual · Content Designer: copy · Design System Lead: tokens
Polish      → Motion Designer: animations · Design System Lead: consistency review
Delivery    → Build implementation · Preview to verify · Deploy if requested
```

### 5. Build the Implementation

Default output: **single-file HTML with Tailwind CSS** unless the project uses a different stack.

Implementation standards:
- Semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>` — not nested divs)
- Responsive design with breakpoints at 375px, 768px, 1280px+
- Dark mode support via `prefers-color-scheme` or `data-theme` attribute
- CSS custom properties for all design tokens (colors, spacing, type scale)
- Accessible markup: proper contrast (4.5:1 min), focus styles, ARIA labels
- Smooth transitions on interactive elements (150-300ms, ease-out)
- Inter font via CDN, Lucide icons where needed

Write the final HTML to **`design-output.html`** in the current working directory.
This is the canonical handoff artifact — used by `/design-framework` and `/design-review`.

### 6. Preview & Verify

Use the Preview MCP tools to show live results:
1. Start preview server
2. Take screenshot at desktop width
3. Check responsive at mobile (375px)
4. Verify interactive states work (hover, focus, click)
5. Run a quick accessibility pass (contrast, keyboard nav)

### 7. Framework Handoff

**If `FRAMEWORK != null`:**
Invoke `/design-framework` with the resolved `FRAMEWORK` value and `design-output.html` as arguments — e.g., `/design-framework react-tailwind design-output.html` — to convert the HTML output
into idiomatic framework components. The framework specialist will:
- Decompose the page into a component hierarchy
- Generate typed props interfaces
- Map CSS custom properties to framework token equivalents
- Output framework-native files (`.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, or `.astro`)

**If `FRAMEWORK == null`:**
HTML output is complete. After delivering, suggest:
- "`/design-framework react-tailwind design-output.html` — convert to React components"
- "Or set `js_framework: react` in settings.local.md for automatic conversion next time"

### 8. Quality Review

Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Output matches the creative direction set in Step 2
- [ ] Responsive at 375px, 768px, 1280px+
- [ ] Accessible (contrast, keyboard nav, semantic HTML)
- [ ] Copy is clear, helpful, and action-oriented
- [ ] Animations are purposeful and smooth
- [ ] Consistent tokens/patterns throughout
- [ ] No placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum") in final output

### Memory Write

If `.naksha/memory.md` exists: append a summary entry:
```
[{ISO timestamp}] /design: {one-line summary of key design decisions made, e.g., "Landing page, hero split layout, primary-500 CTA, Inter font"}
```

## MCP Fallback

If Preview MCP tools are unavailable, write the HTML file and tell the user to open it in a browser. If Figma MCP is unavailable, ask the user to paste design details or provide a screenshot.

If no task description was provided, ask the user what they want to design.

## What's Next

After completing a design, suggest relevant follow-up commands:
- `/design-review` — audit the output for quality issues
- `/design-system` — extract tokens from the design for reuse
- `/figma-create` — recreate the design in Figma for the design team
- `/design-present` — build a presentation to share with stakeholders
