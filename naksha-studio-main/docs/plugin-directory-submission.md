### Description

A virtual design team for Claude Code — 26 roles, 63 commands, 15,000+ lines of design knowledge.
```

**Long description:**
```
Naksha assembles specialist roles automatically based on what you're designing. UI Designer, UX Researcher, Content Designer, Motion Designer, Figma Expert, Email Designer, Data Viz Designer, Brand Strategist, Conversational Designer, Spatial Designer, Compliance Designer, and more — 26 roles total.

60 slash commands cover the full design-to-code pipeline: /design builds pages and components, /design-review audits for accessibility and usability, /design-system extracts tokens, /design-framework converts HTML to React/Vue/Svelte/Next.js/Astro, /figma-create builds Figma frames, /email-template generates production HTML emails, /chart-design produces accessible data visualizations, /design-chatbot designs chatbot UIs, /design-voice-ui designs voice interfaces, /design-spatial builds visionOS/WebXR specs, /design-gdpr generates GDPR consent flows, /design-compliance audits for HIPAA/PCI/ADA, and more.

Over 15,000 lines of expert design knowledge, source-attributed from authoritative references (WCAG, Nielsen heuristics, Refactoring UI, MJML docs, Apple HIG, GDPR Art. 7/12/17, etc.).

v4.0.0 adds project memory (/naksha-init stores brand, framework, and design decisions across sessions), agentic pipelines (/pipeline chains multiple commands automatically), vision-powered reviews (/design-compare and /competitive-audit capture and analyze any URL), and three new frontier wings (Conversational, Spatial/AR, Compliance).

Also works in Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and VS Code Copilot.
