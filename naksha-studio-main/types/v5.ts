/**
 * naksha v5 — Design Agent Interface Contract
 *
 * This file is a DESIGN DOCUMENT expressed in TypeScript type notation.
 * It is not compiled or executed. It defines the schema contract that
 * all v5 capabilities (browser vision, persistent memory, agentic pipelines)
 * build to.
 *
 * Read alongside: docs/naksha-memory-schema.md (authoritative field-level spec)
 *
 * Build sequence: v5.0 Browser → v5.1 Memory Expansion → v5.2 Pipeline Runtime
 * Design sequence: all types defined here, before any v5 code is written.
 *
 * Key constraint: naksha commands are markdown prompt files, not function calls.
 * The actual injection mechanism is prompt prepending. The actual memory write
 * mechanism is the Claude Code Stop hook parsing structured HTML comment blocks.
 * These TypeScript types define the INTENT; the implementation is prompt-level.
